# ruby-walkthrough

It's been a while since I first learned **Ruby**. Now I want to use it again so I'm creating this project to use for learning and for future reference.

## Starting point

[Ruby Programming by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dji9ALCgfpM): even though it's a 2015 video it's fast, cuts to the chase and it's clutter-free.

## VS Code extensions

It's as simple a searching for **ruby** within **VS Code**:

- [Ruby → Shopify.ruby-extensions-pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-extensions-pack): An opinionated and auto-configured set of extensions for Ruby development → it's an extension pack with 2 extensions
  - [Ruby LSP → Shopify.ruby-lsp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.ruby-lsp): VS Code plugin for connecting with the Ruby LSP. The Ruby LSP is an implementation of the [language server protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for Ruby, used to improve rich features in editors.
  - [Ruby Sorbet → sorbet.sorbet-vscode-extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sorbet.sorbet-vscode-extension): Ruby IDE features, powered by [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/).

My choice: I'll install **Ruby** to get **Ruby LSP** and **Ruby Sorbet** installed

**Notice**: when enabled both **Spinel** and **Spinel Light** themes are suggested as they seem to work well with **Ruby**
